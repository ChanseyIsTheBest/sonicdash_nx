/* nx_dual_pointer.h -- two independent on-screen cursors for the Color Sheep
 * Switch port. Derived from the single-cursor nx_pointer module, rebuilt for
 * two simultaneous pointers that feed the game's existing multi-touch path.
 *
 * LEFT cursor  (blue): left stick, or the left Joy-Con's gyro.
 * RIGHT cursor (red):  right stick, or the right Joy-Con's gyro.
 * Both are live at all times, so a tap from each in the same frame delivers two
 * simultaneous fingers to the game (real two-finger input, e.g. pinch).
 *
 * Controls
 * --------
 *   Touchscreen   handheld only, always live (host still owns real touch)
 *   '+'           toggle both cursors on / off (hidden = not drawn, not tapping)
 *   '-'           toggle gyro pointing on / off (affects both cursors)
 *   Left stick    move the LEFT (blue) cursor
 *   Right stick   move the RIGHT (red) cursor
 *   L             recenter the LEFT cursor to mid-screen
 *   R             recenter the RIGHT cursor to mid-screen
 *   ZL            tap with the LEFT cursor
 *   ZR            tap with the RIGHT cursor
 *   D-pad U/D     adjust the sensitivity of whatever is driving the cursors
 *                 (gyro if gyro is on, else the sticks) -- one control for both
 *   Gyro          tilt/turn to point: left Joy-Con drives the blue cursor, right
 *                 Joy-Con drives the red one. Yaw -> X, pitch -> Y.
 *
 * Custom cursor
 * -------------
 * If <data_dir>/cursor.png exists and is at most 64x64, it is used as the cursor
 * shape (alpha respected). The SAME image is drawn for both cursors, tinted blue
 * for the left and red for the right. If no PNG is present, a built-in vector
 * arrow is drawn, also tinted per side.
 *
 * Settings
 * --------
 * Stick and gyro sensitivities live in <data_dir>/pointer.cfg, loaded at startup
 * and saved 3 seconds after the last change (so a burst of D-pad presses costs
 * one write, not twenty).
 *
 * USB mouse support from the original module is retained in the source but
 * compiled out (NXDP_ENABLE_MOUSE 0); this port is touch + controller only.
